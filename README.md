Concpet Summary:
## **High concept**

Create your own collection of cards as you embody a witch and construct your social and moral standings with a local town from the ground up through the practise of [Tarot](https://www.notion.so/Research-and-Context-b7ec1e72273841f3b14b03be194c258e) and other forms of [witchcraft](https://www.notion.so/Research-and-Context-b7ec1e72273841f3b14b03be194c258e); whilst simultaneously dealing with the forces of light and dark and the consequences that their actions might bring upon the world as we know it.

### **Core gameplay**

The player embodies a witch who has to stay alive, hidden, and prosperous as a witch. At the same time, they build their community and interact with the townspeople by making decisions and influencing villagers for better or worse. Who knows where their decisions will lead them and what effect that will have on the world at large? Do the players intend to bring about ruin or prosperity?
